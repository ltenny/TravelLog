# Travel Log

This simple React + Vite application demonstrates some core features of React such as hooks and routing. This entire
application runs in the browser from a static website.

In this application, the user can click on a world map to record places they have visited. Of course, since this is a demo application, nothing is really saved. However, most of the code is in place to provide enough security to track who is using the application and pages are protected from unauthorized users. A fake user (Jack) is hard-coded.
